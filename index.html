    <h2 class = "standard">About me</h2>
    <p class = "standard">Hello and welcome to my portfolio site. I am a former science teacher with a degree in biology.
         Whilst I was teaching, I learned how to use programs like Microsoft Excel much more proficiently.
     I loved how if you used the right formulas, Excel could do so much work automatically without having to add anything up or look anything up.
     I learned how to used vlookup, if statements, conditional formatting, filters, mail merge and many other tools that made handling data much easier.
     From there I stumbled across coding as one of my friends had recently completed a coding bootcamp at Northcoders and reccomended it to me.
     At first, I was hesitant as I hadn't done any computer programming before. This soon started to change as I undertook some of the work Northcoders set me.
     I found that code was beautifully logical and flexible. It was like the work I had done with Excel where the more work you put in and the more you research, the more elegant and powerful your code becomes.
     After falling out of love with the teaching profession, I looked towards coding as a new career. As data was something I was initially interested in I discovered that many of the data jobs required a good knowledge or the programming language SQL.
     Considering this, I undertook and completed a course on Udemy that taught how to SQL, from beginner to the relatively advanced. I also started to learn Python, again on udemy until finally I had the courage to apply for a place on Northcoders coding bootcamp course.
     Whilst completing the precourse work, I learned javascript, HTML and CSS (Which I am using to create this website!). Now, as of writing, I am still practicing my code during the lockdown and hope to start with Northcoders as soon as the lockdown is over.""  </p>
