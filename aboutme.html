        <p>Hello! My name is Ben and I'm a trainee full stack developer. While I used to teach science, I've since been
            looking for something
            new and code stood out as a really fun and creative thing to do as well as being a fresh new challenge.
            I've only just begun my journey into code and have already learned a lot. I can't wait to start my new
            career in
            tech
            and see how far I can go. I hope you enjoy looking at my portfolio site and can see the kind of work that
            I'm
            capable of.
            <br>
            <br>
            In terms of programming, I am most experienced with javascipt and node. I have also learned SQL (oracle)
            online using udemy as well postgres PSQL at Northcoders.
            I am also about halfway through another udemy course to learn Python and have learned almost all of the
            fundamentals. As you can tell from
            this website, I also know how to use HTML and CSS to build websites. I can also use react.
        </p>
