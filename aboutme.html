        <h2 class=sub_title>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Ben and I'm a trainee full stack developer. While I used to teach science, I've since been
            looking for something
            new and code stood out as a really fun and creative thing to do as well as being a fresh new challenge.
            I've only just begun my journey into code and have already learned a lot. I can't wait to start my new
            career in
            tech
            and see how far I can go. I hope you enjoy looking at my portfolio site and can see the kind of work that
            I'm
            capable of.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sub_title">Me as a person</h2>
        <p>As a person, I'd describe myself as chatty, outgoing and enthusiastic. I'm quite sociable and
            I love being around other people. In my spare time, I enjoy mostly gaming. I have lots of different
            communities that I'm a part of. I play on a minecraft server and I also speedrun the game Celeste.
            Speedrunning is where you try and complete a game as fast as possible. I've also learned how to make
            videos on youtube which has been really fun. I've had to learn how to capture video and audio, how to
            edit videos and even a little 3D animation. I like watching streams, videos on youtube and TV as well.
        </p>

<!-- In terms of programming, I am most experienced with javascipt and node. I have also learned SQL (oracle)
            online using udemy as well postgres PSQL at Northcoders.
            I am also about halfway through another udemy course to learn Python and have learned almost all of the
            fundamentals. As you can tell from
            this website, I also know how to use HTML and CSS to build websites. I can also use react. -->
